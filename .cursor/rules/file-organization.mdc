# File Organization Guidelines

## Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for file and folder names: `user-management`, `course-form.tsx`
- Use PascalCase for React components: `LoginForm`, `CourseCard`
- Use camelCase for functions and variables: `createCourse`, `userId`
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants: `DATABASE_URL`, `API_BASE_URL`

## Directory Structure Patterns

### Apps Structure
```
apps/nextjs/src/
├── app/                    # Next.js App Router
│   ├── (auth)/            # Auth route group
│   ├── (protected)/       # Protected route group
│   ├── (public)/          # Public route group
│   └── api/               # API routes
├── auth/                  # Auth configuration
├── components/            # App-specific components
├── lib/                   # App-specific utilities
└── trpc/                  # tRPC client setup
```

### Package Structure
```
packages/{package-name}/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts          # Main export file
│   └── ...               # Feature files
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Import/Export Patterns
- Use barrel exports in `index.ts` files
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Group imports: external → internal packages → relative
- Use absolute imports with workspace aliases (`@nucleus/...`)

## Route Organization
- Use Next.js route groups for logical organization
- Place shared components in route group `components/` folders
- Keep page-specific logic close to the page file
- Use `layout.tsx` for shared layouts within route groups

## Component Co-location
- Place components near where they're used
- Share components only when used across multiple route groups
- Keep form components with their respective pages when possible

## Configuration Files
- Keep package-specific configs in package roots
- Use shared configs from `tooling/` for common patterns
- Maintain separate `.env` files per package when needed
